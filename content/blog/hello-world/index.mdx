Welcome to my blog. This post doubles as a test of the MDX pipeline and a quick
intro to the features available for future writing.

## Code highlighting

TypeScript with Shiki dual-theme (light and dark):

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```

A JSX example:

```tsx
function Card({ title, children }: { title: string; children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="rounded-lg border p-4">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## GitHub Flavored Markdown

Tables, strikethrough, and task lists all work out of the box.

| Feature            | Status |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| Syntax highlighting | Done  |
| oEmbed embeds      | Done   |
| Draft preview      | Done   |
